					My ‘overriding concept’ is the journey many transgender people embark
					on in search of beauty. It is a journey I am still on, and one I will
					explore in my artwork. Transgender people tend to be unhappy with
					their appearance since it typically does not align with their gender
					identity. Simply telling a trans person to accept the way they look
					can be somewhat transphobic, because a big part of what it means to be
					trans, at least for me, is the desire to look more gender-neutral.
					<br />
          <br />
					I’ll admit I care about beauty, despite knowing I am not supposed to
					care about beauty. Since there is this idea that caring about beauty
					makes you shallower. And I believe this topic quickly becomes very
					relatable for everyone, whether you are trans or not. After all,
					beauty is associated with moral worth. Studies show that
					conventionally attractive people are more likely to be assumed to be
					happy, healthy, and trustworthy.
					<br />
          <br />
					I still do not feel beautiful, and as a result, I continue to attempt
					to erase what makes me appear masculine. And I know someone will say
					to me, “Gender norms are just a social construct, you shouldn’t care
					about them.” But eliminating gender seems like a pretty hard task for
					one enby. That said, many cis women I know don’t so much as shave
					their legs. Perhaps, I am not attempting to be gender neutral but
					instead doing everything I can to not look like the caricature of a
					knuckly, hairy, burgeoning transgender person.
					<br />
          <br />
					That said, I realize that I may only feel beautiful if I change how I
					think. Many people, including myself, must forgive themselves for
					wanting to be beautiful. Instead of beauty, what about style? You can
					be stylish in whatever way you want, at whatever age. Style is a way
					of cultivating a personal aesthetic that you control completely.
					<br />
          <br />
					My artwork will attempt to encapsulate these ideas, and how beauty can
					be especially haunting for trans people, and how style is a possible
					alternative. My body of work may expand across different mediums, but
					it will be cohesive through my overriding concept. This body of work
					will be both sad and happy, speaking not only of the light at the end
					of the tunnel but the hardship, discomfort, and disgust that lurks
					throughout.
