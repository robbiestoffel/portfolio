					How do you appear to the world? This is a tumultuous topic, one often
					best not to dwell on, lest you become shallow. ‘Do not let this plague
					you,’ they say. ‘Beauty is not something you should care about.’ But I
					cannot accept. For I exist outside the gender binary, setting me even
					farther from my idolized beauty. My artwork depicts the quest to
					cultivate style amidst disgust, to break the taboo surrounding the
					challenge of beauty.
